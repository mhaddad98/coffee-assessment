# Coffee Assessment

## Setup

1. **Update Environment Variables**

   Open the `.env` file and update the `SERVER_DB_VOLUME_LOCAL_PATH` variable to point to your local path where you want to persist data.

2. **Run Docker Compose**

    Ensure you have `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed.
    Navigate to the root directory of the project where the docker-compose.yaml file is located and run:
    `docker-compose up --build` or `docker compose up --build`
